  My name is Naveen Valecha, a Drupal enthusiast and developer from India.

  I started working with Drupal after joining an Indian Organization in 2011 after a little experience with PHP, HTML and CSS.I really liked web development in Drupal from the beginning as I like to learn more about web-design and web-building, I started using Drupal for other projects of mine and of others.

  Valecha Tech is a Drupal blog that covers tutorials related to Drupal modules and themes as well as their development.
