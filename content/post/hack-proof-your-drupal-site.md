<p>Security of the Drupal website is a important stuff for the site owners, site developers.This blog post has my presentation at the&nbsp;<a href="http://2015.drupalmumbai.org/drupalcamp-mumbai/sessions/hack-proof-your-drupal-site">Drupal Camp Mumbai</a>&nbsp;that &nbsp;intended for Drupalers who want to avoid security loop holes while writing code or architecting solutions. We delved into common security issues that ails custom code and has both vulnerable and secure code snippets.This is mostly about my encounters and experience after doing&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/439043">50+ project application reviews</a>&nbsp;and also a good guideline for new contributors.</p>
